---

I am a graduate student pursuing my MS in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University. I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2016 with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science.

I am an editor at [The Linguist List](https://www.linguistlist.org/), where I edit Jobs, Supports, Books and Reviews. I also work on the Yiddish Speech Corpus within the [GORILLA](https://gorilla.linguistlist.org/) project.
