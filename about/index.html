			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>  I am a graduate student pursuing my MS in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University. I graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2016 with a BA in Linguistics and a minor in Computer Science. I am an editor at <a href="https://www.linguistlist.org/">The Linguist List</a>, where I edit Jobs, Supports, Books and Reviews. I also work on the Yiddish Speech Corpus within the <a href="https://gorilla.linguistlist.org/">GORILLA project.</a></p>
