## Welcome to my homepage


Hello! I'm Clare, a computer scientist living in southern Indiana. I love solving hard problems, learning weird things, and just plain *making stuff happen*. 

My educational background is primarily in linguistics—I have always loved studying grammar and foreign languages! Although my bachelor's is in linguistics, a minor in computer science opened my eyes to the amazing world of programming. I was swept off my feet by algorithms and efficiency, design and debugging.

In May 2018, I received my MS in Computational Linguistics. The program allowed me to deepen my understanding of software engineering, develop a strong programming skillset, and further broaden my experience in linguistics, with special attention to topics in morpho-syntax and semantics. I especially enjoyed the most difficult courses, finding myself challenged and fascinated by data structures, linear algebra, Bayesian statistics, Markov decision processes and other technical topics. 

I see it as a giant, flashing positive sign that all the hardest courses I have taken have only enticed me further into the field of computational lingiustics!

In my spare time—away from my computer—I like to spend time with my dog, enjoying the great city and state parks we have in Indiana. Other interests of mine include improv comedy podcasts, reading, camping, cooking and baking, board games and RPGs, gardening, and making music.

When it comes down to it, I really do just like making stuff happen, whether it be road trips, game nights, or group projects. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to keep learning, growing and *doing*.
